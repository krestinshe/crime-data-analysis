# crime-data-analysis
Data analysis and visualization assignment for ECON 3255 - Economics of Crime, taken in fall 2022 at Cornell University with Professor Max Kapustin.

This project is meant to display my skills in data wrangling, analysis, and visualization. It contains my solutions for a data assignment given in my Economics of Crime class. The dataset I worked with contains official data on crime in the United States from 1960-2020 from the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting program, and has over 1 million observations. The RMarkdown file contains the questions, my answers, and the R code I wrote to answer them. The PDF is the output of the RMarkdown file, and contains everything in the RMarkdown file as well as the final tables and graphs produced by my code.
